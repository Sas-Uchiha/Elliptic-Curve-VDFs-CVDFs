# Anonymous: Elliptic-Curve-VDFs-CVDFs
VDFs and CVDFs implementation using Elliptic Curve

Note: Sometimes the evaluation algorithm may return (-1,-1) which is the infinite value of the elliptic curve. In case this happens please run the simulation again. Since the parameter of the elliptic curve use a pseudo-random generator, you may even have to run the code 4 or 5 times to get a result.
